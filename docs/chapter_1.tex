\chapter{Theoretische Grundlagen}
In this section the theoretical foundation of this thesis will be laid to understand the problem and the components used to solve it. First the dataset KIT-Motion Dataset combines both the motion themselves as xml-Data in the mmm-format, and to each motion a textual annotation has been assigned. Thus making it semantically rich and allowing natural language processing to be used to solve the problem.
